# MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATION ON TITANIC DATASET

The dataset I am using here is about the RMS Titanic known as the unsinkable ship and was the largest, most luxurious passenger ship of its time.
Sadly, the British ocean liner sank on April 15, 1912, killing over 1500 people while just 705 survived.
The dataset includes information about the passengers who had travelled in the Titanic.

Following are the fields in dataset which we used for train the model.

PassengerId: ID of the passenger Survived:
   Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes) Pclass: Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd) 

Name: Name of the passenger 

Sex: Sex of the passenger 

Age: age of primary policyholder 

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard 

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard 

Ticket: Ticknet number of the passenger 

Fare: Passenger fare (British pound) 

Cabin: The cabin passengers were provided to stay within the ship 

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton) 
     *bold text *PassengerId: ID of the passenger

Survived: Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)

Pclass: Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)


Objective:

 1. To determine if there is a relationship between attributes and the survival rate.
 2. Prove (or disprove) that the passengers who travelled in class 1 had a high survival rate than those who didn't?

 The key questions that we would be asking are:
 
 
      **1. What sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
      2. How valid is the model we have built?
      3. What can we do to improve the model?**
     
 
 The Major steps includes:
 
 
   DATA CLEANING 
   
   EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
   
   DATA PREPROCESSING
   
   DATA SCALING
   
   DATA VISUALIZATION
   
   TRAINING DIFFERENT MODELS:
   
      1.LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL
      2.POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION MODEL
      3.SVM MODEL
      
   HYPOTHESIS TESTING
   
   EVALUATION USING CLASSIFICATION MATRIX
   
   CONCLUSION
